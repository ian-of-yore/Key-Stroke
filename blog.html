                        Both the localStorage and sessionStorage are storages that are used in the browser. Their uses
                        and differences
                        are based on the service they provide to the browser. The sessionStorage only lasts as long as
                        the browser tab is
                        in action. Once a specific tab or the browser is closed meaning that page session ends, the
                        sessionStorage gets cleared. On the
                        other hand, the localStorage doesn't expire. The data that are being written there is permanent
                        unless a user explicityly removes or
                        alternates the data. Even when a page session or the browser is closed, the data in localStorage
                        is kept saved.

                        Global scope refers to the entirety of the program. The overall environment a certain program is
                        using
                        to execute the codes. Whereas, the block scops are associated with certain type of code blocks,
                        like "if-else",
                        "for", "while" or "switch" statements. A variable declared in the global scope is accessible for
                        every components of
                        the overall window.
                        On the ohter hand, variables declared on the block scopes are only accessible within that block.

                    <div class="accordion-body">With the introduction of ES6, JavaScript added a new feature to write
                        multiline code dynamically.
                        This is known as template literals which is done by using back-ticks (``) rather than the
                        conventional use of double ("") or single ('') quotes to define a string.
                        This feature allows the users to insert variables and expressions into strings without needing
                        to concatenate like in older versions of JavaScript.
                        Template strings can be nested in each other. This is a great feature because many people want
                        to create dynamic strings.

                        There's a slight distinguishable difference between the use of <span
                            class="fw-bold">forEach()</span> and <span class="fw-bold">map()</span>.
                        Both of these options perform same type of tasks on an array but their main difference lies in
                        what they
                        return after the operation. Both of <span class="fw-bold">forEach()</span> and <span
                            class="fw-bold">map()</span> is used to execute the same code on
                        every element of
                        the array but <span class="fw-bold">forEach()</span> does not change the array and it return the
                        whole
                        array. Whereas, <span class="fw-bold">map()</span>
                        returns a new array
                        with updated elements.
                        <span class="fw-bold">filter()</span> and <span class="fw-bold">find()</span> are used to
                        search for elements from a collection who satisfies certain
                        criteria. <span class="fw-bold">filter()</span> returns
                        every single element that fulfills a defined logic/argument but <span
                            class="fw-bold">find()</span> only finds and returns
                        the first element that
                        satisfies the query instructions. After finding the first element <span
                            class="fw-bold">find()</span> stops searching and
                        returns only that element.
